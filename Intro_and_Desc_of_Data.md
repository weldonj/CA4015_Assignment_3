## Lit Review and Motivations for Forecasting stage

**Background -** 
In our previous assignment we built a model that could classify sleep stages based on a number of time series features. The next stage is to create a model that will take a look at this same sleep stage data and allow us to forecast how a subject's sleep cycle will look in the immediate future. 

**Motivations for building this Forecasting Model -** 
The Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Sleep Research estimates that between 50 and 70 million Americans have trouble with the duration and the quality of their sleep. They have found that the negative effects of this are even more impactful when the poor quality sleep and/or inadequate sleep duration takes place on a chronic, daily basis, rather than on occasion[1].

The negative effects aren't just physical, Strine and Chapman[2] found that poor sleep quality also has severe negative effects on mental health and wellbeing. Peterman et al[3] also showed a link between sleep disorders and increases in anxiety and depression.
